## This directory contains the scripts used to develop the MODIS Vegetation Indices and Land Surface Temperature data products for the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS). The raw data and initial processing was done using the IRI Data Library http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/.


The data products include the following:

**VegetationIndices** - 250m resolution

* Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)
* Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
* Reflectance Red Band 1
* Reflectance Near-Infrared (NIR) Band 2
* Reflectance Blue Band 3
* Reflectance Mid-Infrared (MIR) Band 7

**LandSurfaceTemp** - 1km resolution
* Land Surface Temperature Day
* Land Surface Temperature Night
